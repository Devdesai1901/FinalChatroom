## Description

This web application is designed to facilitate group discussions on various topics, with the discussion topics set by a designated group admin. Users can share their views and thoughts on the given topics. The application uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the reliability and relevance of the responses. Users who provide the most reliable and insightful answers are awarded more points, contributing to their overall ranking within the group.

Currently, the application's ranking system is driven by NLP, ensuring that the best responses are recognized and rewarded.
